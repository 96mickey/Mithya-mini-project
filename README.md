# Mithya-mini-project

This is a very basic project that show the customer's interaction with a website.

To test the functionality register as a user and then try visiting hotels.

Hotels would not be accessible unless you login to the system.
Once you visit a hotel page you can see the visitors who visited the hotel page.
Also you can see who all have confirmed booking there and ones who made a draft booking.

Once you make a draft booking your status will be marked draft.
You cannot make multiple draft booking on same hotel page.
Once you confirm a booking, the draft booking would be deleted.

Experiment the possiblities here.
